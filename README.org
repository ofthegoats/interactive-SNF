#+title: interactive EOs

An interactive Haskell program for building Smith Normal Form.

Mostly a PoC for a [[file:Matrix.hs][Matrix representation]] -- which I might extend and reuse elsewhere.

The purpose of this program is to interactively carry out elementary row and column operations via a sort of REPL: originally just to make a Smith Normal Form, but there is no such restriction.

Feel free to use and extend this program.

** Requirements

- [[https://www.haskell.org/ghc/][ghc]] installable via [[https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/][ghcup]]
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fin-0.0.3][fin]] (Hackage) installable via =cabal install=

** Building

Once I finish the REPL component, simply load it via =ghci=. Instructions to follow implementation.
